What it does:
- provides a memoization function for C#
- essentially translates the following Lisp (Racket) code into C#:

#lang racket
(define (memoize proc)
  (let ([table (make-hash)])
    (lambda (x)
      (let ([result (hash-ref table x #f)])
        (if result
            result
            (let ([ans (proc x)])
              (hash-set! table x ans)
              ans))))))

Status:
- have a Memoize() extension function that supports up to 4 args (any type)
- unit-tested for speed and correctness with functions that sleep
- really ought to make it support up to 16 args

Background:
Wes Dyer (blogs.msdn.com/b/wesdyer) wrote an excellent blog post in 2007 that suggested a memoization function for C#. In the post he suggested that you could generalize this for functions with n arguments by "creating composite keys of n fields that are used in the dictionary". 

This is a little project to do just that. I'm not adding an awful lot, but hopefully the result will be widely useful.

Rough guide to files:

- Memoize : library containing a single file with the Memoize extension method
- MemoizeTests : NUnit project of tests for speed and correctness

- memoize.rkt : example of memoization in a more functional language (Racket)
- memoise-test.rkt : unit test for the Racket code
